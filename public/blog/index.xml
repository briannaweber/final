      <description>I was not excited to learn python, it took me so long to finally understand are on a basic level. I was scared to switch to a second coding language.
While it was difficult for me to learn python I am glad I did.The part that I enjoyed the most was learning needleman-wunsch and smtih-waterman. I thought it was fun doing it by hand but I could not imagine doing it on a large scale.</description>
