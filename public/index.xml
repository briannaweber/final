      <description>I was not excited to learn python, it took me so long to finally understand are on a basic level. I was scared to switch to a second coding language.
While it was difficult for me to learn python I am glad I did.The part that I enjoyed the most was learning needleman-wunsch and smtih-waterman. I thought it was fun doing it by hand but I could not imagine doing it on a large scale.</description>

      <description>Brianna Weber BAW2929Project 2: Modeling, Testing, and Predicting
data(&amp;quot;Salaries&amp;quot;)The dataset that I picked for this project is the ‘Salaries’ dataset within the ‘carData’ package. This dataset has 397 observations of 6 different variables. These variables are; ‘rank’,‘discipline’,‘yrs.service’, ‘yrs.since.phd’,‘sex’, and ‘salary.’The different levels of rank include Associate professor, Assistant Professor, and Professor. Discipline is broken into two categories, A, “theoretical” departments, and B, “applied” departments. Salary is based on a nine-month salary in dollars.</description>

      <description>Project 1The two datasets that are going to be used are both found within the “dataset” package within R.The first dataset I chose is ‘USArrests’, this is a data set that has four varibles for each of the fifty US states, these variables are ‘Murder’, ‘Assault’, ‘UrbanPop’, and ‘Rape’. Murder, Rape, and Assualt are the number of accounts per 100,000, while UrbanPop is the percent of urban population in that state.</description>
