<p>I was not excited to learn python, it took me so long to finally understand are on a basic level. I was scared to switch to a second coding language.</p>
<p>While it was difficult for me to learn python I am glad I did.
The part that I enjoyed the most was learning needleman-wunsch and smtih-waterman. I thought it was fun doing it by hand but I could not imagine doing it on a large scale. However, luckily in python we were able to create a function that did the scoring for us.</p>
