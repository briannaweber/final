<p>I was not excited to learn python, it took me so long to finally understand are on a basic level. I was scared to switch to a second coding language.</p>
<p>Initially it was really difficult for me to keep basic concepts down, such that in python it starts with 0 while in R it starts with 1.</p>
<p>While it was difficult for me to learn python I am glad I did.
The part that I enjoyed the most was learning needleman-wunsch and smtih-waterman. I thought it was fun doing it by hand but I could not imagine doing it on a large scale. However, luckily in python we were able to create a function that did the scoring for us.</p>
<p>The code we used was:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import numpy as np

# Use these values to calculate scores
match_score = 2
mismatch_score = -1
gap_penalty = -1

seq1 = &quot;ATGAT&quot;
seq2 = &quot;AAGGAT&quot;


def sw_function(seq1,seq2,gap_penalty=-1, match_score=1, mismatch_score=-1):
    m=len(seq1) #length of horizontal sequence
    n=len(seq2) #length of vertical sequence
    score=np.empty(shape=[n+1,m+1]) #array to hold scores
   
    for j in range(0, m + 1): score[0][j] = gap_penalty * j
    for i in range(0, n + 1): score[i][0] = gap_penalty * i
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1): 
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            insert = score[i - 1][j] + gap_penalty 
            delete = score[i][j - 1] + gap_penalty 
            match = score[i - 1][j - 1] + match_score if seq1[j-1]==seq2[i-1] else mismatch_score
            score[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)
    return score


  mat=sw_function(seq1,seq2,gap_penalty,match_score,mismatch_score)

  def sw_fun(mat):
    for i in range(len(mat)):
        for j in range(len(mat[i])):
            if mat[i][j]&lt;0: 
                mat[i][j]=0
            
    return mat

sw_fun(mat)</code></pre>
<p>This allowed us to use score needleman- wunsch as well as smith-waterman.</p>
<p>The only thing that has been difficult for me with python is that my laptop is 32 bit while the code above is for 64 therefore I cannot get it to knit.</p>
